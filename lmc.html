            <h1>Wet Paint</h1>
            <h2>Role: Artist/Painter</h2>
            <p> Wet Paint is a simple 'Unity' computer game that uses classic 2D platformer gamplay and handpainted artwork as an exploration of the intersection between traditional and digital creation.
            It was created in 3 weeks by a team of 4 Georgia Tech students: myself, Avery Bartlett, Mike Adams, and Sammi Hudock. </p>
            <p>You play as an alien on a black and white dystopian planet. As you go through the game
            you find a new 'berry' in each of the levels. Each of these berries is responsible for bringing one color (red, green, and blue) back to your vision.</p>

<!--Unity and the art assets are scans of acrylic on canvas -->

            Wet Paint Role: Artist Wet Paint is a simple computer game that features traditional 2D platformer gamplay and handpainted artwork. It is an exploration
            of the intersection between traditional and digital creation. The game was created in Unity and the art assets are scans of acrylic on canvas. Wet paint was created in 3 weeks by 4 Georgia Tech students: myself, Avery Bartlett, Elena Kusiak,
            and Sammi Hudock. The setting of the game is that you're on an alien black and white dystopian planet. Throughout of the game you find a new 'berry' in each of the levels. Each of these berries is responsible for bringing one color (red, green,
            and blue), back to your vision. The purpose of this game was more about conveying an aesthetic well than about creating the best gameplay experience. We wanted to use the gameplay as a vessel to show off this beautiful art style and storyline,
            rather than using the art and storyline to support the best gameplay we could make. COLOR PROGRESSION EXPLAINED The game starts in black and white, and once you collect the first berry, the world is now green black and white. In the second
            level, you collect the blue berry, making it so that the only color not represented is red. As you can probably guess the third and final level is responsible for illuminating red and thus bringing full color back to the player.
