        <p>
            A current Mechanical Engineering major and Industrial Design minor at Georgia Tech, I am a designer in training who seeks to explore through different lenses to create thoughtful solutions that are as informed as they are captivating.
            <br><br>
            As someone with a broad range of interests ranging from digital interface to mechanical design, it is the immersive process and the possibilities that excite and motivate me.
            <br><br><br>
            Beyond my design and engineering interests, I also enjoy ping pong, painting, and a good book.
